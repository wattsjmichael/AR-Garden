# AR Garden

Since we've never worked on a unity project with other people before, each developer has their own folder, inside of which is their own Unity project.  Only commit and push to your folder if its working on your machine!  Try to keep your folder always working for at least yourself.  No sweat if it doesn't work for others.  

## When to Branch
The shared folder will be a unity project that we should work on everyone's machines.  Any changes to the shared folder should be done in a branch.  Create a Pull Request once you've finished making your changes.  Every developer should then checkout this branch and ensure the shared unity project works for them before approving the pull request
